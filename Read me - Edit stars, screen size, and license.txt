Trippy Stars - Made by Daniël Haazen, also known as Sheepolution. http://danielhaazen.com/
Made in LÖVE - http://love2d.org/

The stars are made by random values. You can edit these values by editing the 'randomvalues.txt' file in..
Windows: Appdata/roaming/Trippy Stars
Mac:  /Users/user/Library/Application Support/Trippy Stars
Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trippy Stars/

These are the standard values and what they mean:
If it says random, it means that it's between 0 and the number.
Minimum points a star has: 		25		-	Every star will have more than this number of points.
Random additional points: 		25
Minimal circle radius: 			5 		- 	The circles grow and shrimp. This is the minimal radius it can shrimp to.
Random inside circle radius: 	610
Random adding outside radius:	200		- 	This will be added to the inside radius.
Minimal spinning speed:			-100	- 	This is a negative number so that it can spin backwards.
Random adding spinning speed:	200 	- 	For a 50/50 chance you make this the absolute number of the minimal spinning speed * 2.
Random grow speed:				500		- 	How fast the circle grow and shrimp.
Random line width: 				10

DO NOT CHANGE THESE ABOVE. It has no effect. You need to change the one in your Appdata folder.
If you want to reset the changes you made you can simply delete it, and it will return with the standard numbers.

To change your screen size, change the numbers in settings.txt as width,height.

I hope you enjoy Trippy Stars. You can always contact me on danielhaazen@hotmail.com or contact@danielhaazen.com
